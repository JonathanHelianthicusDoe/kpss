          Ever thought of playing the entire game of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online">Toontown</a>
          without ever using sound or lure? Probably not, but <em>now</em> you
          have. If that sounds interesting to you as a fun challenge or just as
          a way to balance the game, then it is YOU that we are looking for to
          come play <strong>kiss-pie-storm-safe</strong> (KPSS) Toontown with
          us!

        <h2>About KPSS gameplay</h2>

        <h3>Gag tracks</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS players must be soundless AND lureless AND trapless. In
          practice, this usually means making an ordinary soundless toon, but
          without ever using/training your lure and trap gags. They remain at
          zero gag exp. We do allow leeway with respect to how much exp players
          have in gag tracks that they are supposed to be missing; as long as
          you do not have access to level 2 gags of a certain gag track, you
          are considered to be &ldquo;missing&rdquo; that track. A KPSS player
          does not stock up on gag tracks that they are missing (viz. from gag
          shops), the obvious exception being in preparation for the random
          gag-ups gained from the match-three golf puzzle in cog golf courses,
          since those are unavoidable. A KPSS player also obviously does not
          use gags from gag tracks that they are missing, unless by accident
          (although accidents of this kind are
          <em>exceptionally</em> rare in &ldquo;semi&rdquo; play anyways).

        <h3>Other toons</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS players
          <strong
            >cannot fight any cog(s) with other toons that are not KPSS</strong
          >. Of course, any toon which naturally does not have access to any
          sound, lure, or trap gags (like a toon with 20 max-laff, for example)
          is essentially KPSS by accident, and thus KPSS players can fight cogs
          with them.

        <h3>Additional rules</h3>

        <p>
          Some additional rules apply to KPSS play, and the official
          (&ldquo;vanilla&rdquo;) rules of KPSS are tentative at this point and
          are subject to change. For example, SOS cards that deal with any of
          the three forbidden tracks are not allowed for use in KPSS play, with
          the exception of Professor Pete (as he restocks &ldquo;all
          gags&rdquo;, not specifically any of the forbidden gag tracks). This
          includes both restock SOSs (e.g. Doctor Drift) and gag-using SOSs
          (e.g. Lil Oldman). In practice, this means shopping for SOSs, or
          simply discarding forbidden SOS cards directly after they are
          acquired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Likewise, unites (from CFO) which deal with the forbidden gag tracks
          are also disallowed in KPSS play. In practice, this means using the
          unite right after acquiring it (viz. when talking to Mata Hairy at
          the end of the CFO) any time that unite is a forbidden one. Summons
          (obtained from CJ) and fires (obtained from CEO) may be used freely.
          Doodles may also be used freely.

        <h3>Organic gags</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS toons, like ordinary toons, choose a single gag track that they
          want to make organic. In practice, KPSS play makes any of the four
          possible organic tracks (toonup, throw, squirt, and drop) viable.
          This is in contrast to ordinary play, where organic drop and
          especially organic toonup are frowned upon. KPSS players are
          encouraged to experiment, and to collaborate with other KPSS players
          in deciding which gags to plant.

        <h3>Choosing gags in battle</h3>

        <p>
          Choosing gags is significantly more difficult in KPSS play than in
          normal play. As a result, you may have to change a number of things
          about the way you play the game. Toontown allows for 20 seconds of
          dedicated gag-picking time per round of battle. To make effective use
          of this 20-second timeframe, here are some things to consider:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Talk with your teammates before entering battle, and do some
            strategic preparation and planning; you should know which organic
            gags everyone has, and have at least a basic idea of the kinds of
            combos and strategies you will use throughout the battle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk with your teammates during battle! This includes all parts of
            the battle (waiting for animations, as well as 20-second gag
            picking) and should help make those 20-second timeframes
            less&hellip; telepathic, full of waiting and gag switching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have as many common gag combinations memorized as you can, and use
            a reference if appropriate;
            <a href="./combos/index.html">see here</a> for a handy tool
            tailored to KPSS play. You can also make use of the more flexible
            (but more difficult to use)
            <a
              href="https://github.com/JonathanHelianthicusDoe/gag_combo_gen_web"
              >gag combo generator</a
            >
            to find gag combinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you&rsquo;re not too keen on the arithmetic or just feel a bit
            too tired to do it, there&rsquo;s no shame in having a calculator
            on-hand (or rather, in another window) for calculating remaining
            cog HP and calculating gag damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowing how much damage cogs are capable of dishing out can be
            useful;

            species. See also: &ldquo;<a
