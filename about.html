          Ever thought of playing the entire game of <a
            href="https://www.toontownrewritten.com/">Toontown</a> without ever
          using
          sound or lure? Probably not, but <em>now</em> you have. If that sounds
          interesting to you as a fun challenge or just as a way to balance the
          game, then it is YOU that we are looking for to come play
          <strong>kiss-pie-storm-safe</strong> (KPSS) Toontown with us!

        <h2>About KPSS gameplay</h2>

        <h3>Gag tracks</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS players must be soundless AND lureless AND trapless. In practice,
          this usually means making an ordinary soundless toon, but without ever
          using/training your lure and trap gags. They remain at zero gag exp.
          We do allow leeway with respect to how much exp players have in gag
          tracks that they are supposed to be missing; as long as you do not
          have access to level 2 gags of a certain gag track, you are considered
          to be &#8220;missing&#8221; that track. A KPSS player does not stock
          up on gag tracks they are missing (viz. from gag shops), the obvious
          exception being the random gag-ups gained from the match-three golf
          puzzle in cog golf courses, since those are unavoidable. A KPSS player
          also obviously does not use gags from gag tracks they are missing,
          unless by accident (although accidents of this kind are
          <em>exceptionally</em> rare in &#8220;semi&#8221; play anyways).

        <h3>Other toons</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS players <strong>cannot fight any cog(s) with other toons that are
            not KPSS</strong>. Of course, any toon which
          naturally does not have access to any sound, lure, or trap gags (like
          a 20 laff toon for example) is essentially KPSS by accident, and thus
          KPSS players can fight cogs with them.

        <h3>Additional rules</h3>

        <p>
          Some additional rules apply to KPSS play, and the official
          (&#8220;vanilla&#8221;) rules of KPSS are tentative at this point and
          are subject to change. For example, SOS cards that deal with any of
          the three forbidden tracks are not allowed for use in KPSS play, with
          the exception of Professor Pete (as he restocks &#8220;all
          gags&#8221;, not specifically any of the forbidden gag tracks). This
          includes both restock SOSs (e.g. Doctor Drift) and gag-using SOSs
          (e.g. Lil Oldman). In practice, this means shopping for SOSs, or
          simply discarding forbidden SOS cards directly after they are
          acquired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Likewise, unites (from CFO) which deal with the forbidden gag tracks
          are also disallowed in KPSS play. In practice, this means using the
          unite right after acquiring it (viz. when talking to Mata Hairy at the
          end of the CFO) any time that unite is a forbidden one. Summons
          (obtained from CJ) and fires (obtained from CEO) may be used freely.
          Doodles may also be used freely.

        <h3>Organic gags</h3>

        <p>
          KPSS toons, like ordinary toons, choose a single gag track that they
          want to make organic. In practice, KPSS play makes any of the four
          possible organic tracks (toonup, throw, squirt, and drop) viable. This
          is in contrast to ordinary play, where organic drop and especially
          organic toonup are frowned upon. KPSS players are encouraged to
          experiment, and to collaborate with other KPSS players in deciding
          which gags to plant.

        <h3>Choosing gags in battle</h3>

        <p>
          Choosing gags is significantly more difficult in KPSS play than in
          normal play. As a result, you may have to change a number of things
          about the way you play the game. TTR allows for 20 seconds of
          dedicated gag-picking time per round of battle. To make effective use
          of this 20-second timeframe, here are some things to consider:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Talk with your teammates before entering battle, and do some
            strategic preparation and planning; you should know which organic
            gags everyone has, and have at least a basic idea of the kinds of
            combos and strategies you will use throughout the battle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk with your teammates during battle! This includes all parts of
            the battle (waiting for animations, as well as 20-second gag
            picking) and should help make those 20-second timeframes less...
            telepathic, full of waiting and gag switching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have as many common gag combinations memorized as you can, and use a
            reference if appropriate; we recommend <a
              href="https://zz.nfshost.com">https://zz.nfshost.com</a> for
            finding gag combinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're not too keen on the arithmetic or just feel a bit too
            tired to do it, there's no shame in having a calculator on-hand (or
            rather, in another window) for calculating remaining cog HP/gag
            damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowing how much damage cogs are capable of dishing out can be
            useful; <a href="https://toontownrewritten.fandom.com/wiki/">the
              Toontown Rewritten Wiki</a> has all the numbers laid out on the
            articles for the various cog species.
