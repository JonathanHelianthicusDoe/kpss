        <p>
          Ever thought of playing the entire game of <a
            href="https://www.toontownrewritten.com/">Toontown</a> without ever
          using
          sound or lure? Probably not, but <em>now</em> you have. If that sounds
          interesting to you as a fun challenge or just as a way to balance the
          game, then it is YOU that we are looking for to come play
          <strong>kiss-pie-storm-safe</strong> (KPSS) Toontown with us!

        <h2>What?</h2>

        <p>
          Kiss-pie-storm-safe is a self-imposed style of playing
          <a href="https://www.toontownrewritten.com/">Toontown (TTR)</a> in
          which you make toons that are soundless AND lureless AND trapless. You
          may have heard of a toon missing multiple gag tracks referred to as
          &#8220;semi&#8221;, and that&#8217;s where this style of play
          originates. KPSS takes this concept to a sort of extreme, such that
          you <em>only</em> ever play with other toons who are also
          soundless-lureless-trapless (at least, when it comes to anything
          involving cogs).

        <h2>But, why?</h2>

        <p>
          To have fun. More specifically, the goals of KPSS are threefold:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            To make the game more challenging by making strategizing much more
            intense than in normal play, and by making cog encounters more
            risky.
          </li>
          <li>
            To emphasize team play and cooperation by increasing the challenge
            and removing trivial ways of effectively removing cogs from battle
            (sound and lure).
          </li>
          <li>
            To balance cog-fighting gameplay by removing an overpowered gag
            track (sound) and empowering underpowered ones (toonup and drop,
            especially organic).
          </li>
        </ul>
