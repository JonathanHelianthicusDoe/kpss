        <p>
          Ever thought of playing the entire game of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online">Toontown</a>
          without ever using sound or lure? Probably not, but <em>now</em> you
          have. If that sounds interesting to you as a fun challenge or just as
          a way to balance the game, then it is YOU that we are looking for to
          come play <strong>kiss-pie-storm-safe</strong> (KPSS) Toontown with
          us!

        <h2>Gag combo table</h2>

        <p>
          This is an interactive table of gag combos that are useful in KPSS
          play. You can use this as a reference/cheatsheet, and it should
          hopefully be handy enough that you can use it while in battle
          in-game. Exactly which combos are included here is subject to some
          simplifying assumptions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            All cogs are assumed to be level 7 or higher. This is because cogs
            below level 7 have too few HP for this approach to be useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            All cogs are assumed to be at 100% HP. This table only considers
            very simple strategies: ones that can be used to take a cog from
            100% HP to less than 1 HP in a single round.
          </li>
          <li>
            All cogs are assumed to be v1.0 cogs. Version 2.0 cogs are not
            handled specially here, although, of course, many of these combos
            will be useful against v2.0 cogs as well; you just have to use your
            judgement.
          </li>
          <li>
            All toons are assumed to be maxed in all four KPSS gag tracks
            (toonup, throw, squirt, and drop).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The percentages beneath each combo indicate the probability that the
          entire combo will succeed (i.e. all gags in the combo hit their
          target). In cases where two percentages are given, the latter
          percentage &mdash; the one
          <span class="dark toonup">in purple</span> &mdash; represents the
          effective probability that all of the gags in the combo hit, given
          that one toon uses a multi-target toonup gag (generally Bamboo Cane
          or Juggling Cubes). This probability <em>includes</em> outcomes in
          which all gags in the combo hit, but the toonup gag misses.
        </p>

        <p>
          For each given cog level and number of gags, the combos are ordered
          &mdash; roughly &mdash; with more &ldquo;preferable&rdquo; combos
          towards the top. This preference does not take the accuracy into
          account very much; the actual accuracy can be situational, and the
          minimum acceptable accuracy is also situational. Instead, more
          &ldquo;preferable&rdquo; combos are those that do not drain the
          overall &ldquo;power&rdquo; of the group as much. Although the
          &ldquo;power&rdquo; of individual gags is also situational, the idea
          is that, over a long-run average, some gags are &ldquo;worth&rdquo;
          more than others (in some appropriate sense).
        </p>

        <p>
          The gags within each combo are ordered from left to right in the
          order that they are actually used in-game. This means that certain
          tracks go before others (throw before squirt, squirt before drop); to
          break ties (in the case of multiple gags from the same track), gags
          are used in ascending order of the damage that each gag deals. This
          tie-breaking may not <em>seem</em> relevant, but it is semantically
          part of Toontown, because it has a large impact on how v2.0 cogs take
          damage (or don&rsquo;t take damage, as the case may be&hellip;).
